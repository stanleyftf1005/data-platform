export const rawText = "In a 5-l. flask, fitted with stirrer, separatory funnel, exit tube, and thermometer, is placed 3.5 kg. (2 l., 30 moles) of chlorosulfonic acid (Note 1), and to it is slowly added, with continuous stirring, 780 g. (888 cc., 10 moles) of benzene (Note 2), keeping the temperature between 20° and 25° by means of cold water. The hydrogen chloride which is evolved is led to a hood or absorbed in water. The addition requires two to three hours; when this is complete, the mixture is stirred for one hour, and poured upon 6–7 kg. of crushed ice (Note 3). One liter of carbon tetrachloride is then added, the oil is separated as soon as possible (Note 4), and the watery layer is shaken with 500 cc. of carbon tetrachloride. The combined extracts are washed with dilute sodium carbonate, and the bulk of the carbon tetrachloride is distilled under atmospheric pressure (Note 5); the pressure is then reduced (Note 6) and the benzenesulfonyl chloride collected at 113–115° /10 mm. (118–120° /15 mm.). The yield is 1320–1360 g. (75–77 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a colorless liquid which on cooling sets to a crystalline solid melting at 13-14°."
